### Projects
My projects make use of a recently developed path-integral based approach, Trotter's decomposition with linked cluster expansion. This approach gives us an *exact* solution to various quantum system dynamics in the presence of phonons. I developed a modified algorithm which addressed a major limitation -  only systems that have a cavity present were solvable. Now we are able to treat qubit only systems, exploring various coupling mechanisms, such as FÃ¶rster coupling. The applications of this method are far reaching, from biology to quantum computing and cryptography. In addition to this method, we have developed and implemented a conceptually simple optimisation scheme, avoiding huge tensor multiplication which doubles the number of neighbours in the tensor network and halves computation time. Below are the repositories to solve various systems along with the published papers.
