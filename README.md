### Projects
My projects make use of a recently developed path-integral based approach, Trotter's decomposition with linked cluster expansion. This approach gives us an *exact* solution to various quantum system dynamics in the presence of phonons. I developed a modified algorithm which addressed a major limitation -  only systems that have a cavity mode (or any mode uncoupled to phonons) present were solvable. Now we are able to treat qubit only systems, exploring various coupling mechanisms, such as FÃ¶rster coupling. The applications of this method have various applications, from biology to quantum computing. In addition to this, we have developed and implemented a conceptually simple optimisation scheme, avoiding huge tensor multiplication which doubles the number of neighbours in the tensor network. The highlight the extent of the optimisation scheme, we are now able to achieve a level of neighbours on a standard office computer which previously required a computer with over 200,000GB of RAM! Furthermore, calculations which previously would take many days now take a matter of seconds.
