### Projects
My projects make use of a recently developed path-integral based approach, Trotter's decomposition with linked cluster expansion. This approach gives us an *exact* solution to various quantum system dynamics in the presence of phonons. I developed a modified algorithm which solved a previous limitation -  only systems that have a cavity present were solvable. Now we are able to treat qubit only systems, providing access to study previously inaccessible coupling mechanisms, such as FÃ¶rster coupling. This has implications in many areas such as quantum computing and even biology.
