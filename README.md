### About me
I will soon be completing a PhD in Theoretical Physics within the condensed matter and photonics group, [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/research-groups/condensed-matter-and-photonics) at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/), supervised by Dr Egor Muljarov and Prof Wolfgang Langbein.

### Projects
My projects make use of a recently developed path-integral based approach, Trotter's decomposition with linked cluster expansion [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10977)]. This approach gives us an *exact* solution to various quantum system dynamics in the presence of phonons. I developed a modified algorithm which addressed a major limitation - only systems that have a cavity mode (or any mode uncoupled to phonons) present were solvable. Now we are able to treat qubit only systems, exploring various coupling mechanisms, such as FÃ¶rster coupling. The result of this research can have various applications, from biology to quantum computing. As a result of this development, we noticed an interesting feature in the dephasing rates of systems containing two (or more) spatially separated quantum dots, that the decoherence of a coupled qubit system can be minimized, or even eliminated by exploiting the quantum coherence of the bath itself [[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14685)]. In addition to this, we have developed and implemented a conceptually simple optimisation scheme, avoiding huge tensor multiplication which doubles the number of neighbours in the tensor network. To highlight the extent of the optimisation scheme, we are now able to achieve the same amount of neighbours on a standard office computer which would previously require a supercomputer with over 200,000GB of RAM! Furthermore, calculations which would take many days now take a matter of seconds.
